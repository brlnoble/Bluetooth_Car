# Bluetooth_Car

Work in progress.

Creating a remote control car from scratch using drill motors to drive, and servos to steer. An Arduino is being used for interfacing with the hardware, and a Raspberry Pi for Bluetooth capabilities and processing. Currently using a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller as the remote, allowing for steering, speed controls, etc.
